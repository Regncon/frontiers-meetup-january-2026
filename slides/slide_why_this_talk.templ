/*
Slide: Why this talk (start-with-why)

Intent:
- This is the "why of the talk", not the "why of the projects".
- Keep it humble, story-first, and non-spicy.
- Avoid framing as a framework/ideology debate on the slide itself.
- Goal is not to change minds; it's to share honest experience and spread ideas/viewpoints.

Slide design:
- Only ONE bullet point (one why), big text, lots of whitespace.
- No visual on this slide.

On-slide copy (single bullet):
- “We want to share a real experience: what worked, what didn’t, what surprised us.”

Presenter notes (tone + subtext to say out loud):
- We’re not here to change anyone’s mind.
- People aren’t rational — data helps, but stories travel.
- This isn’t a framework debate; we’re sharing learnings and perspectives from two real builds.
- We’ll back up some claims with numbers and demos, but the goal is: new ideas you can try.
