/*
Slide: What we built in 2024 (factual snapshot)

Intent:
- Give the audience a concrete picture of what the 2024 app actually did.
- Keep it factual and grounded so later tradeoffs (RSC, Firebase, complexity) have context.
- Highlight the core workflow: participants indicate interest in events.

Domain terms:
- "Pulje" = time slot grouping (e.g., Friday evening, Saturday morning, ...).

Key flows:
- Participant: browse events by pulje → mark interest level → submit to the festival.
- Admin: edit/clean/publish event text, help with ticketing issues, assign participants to events based on interest.

			<li>Everything revolves around one thing: find an event and indicate interest.</li>
			<li>We spent a lot of UX attention on making that flow feel good.... we failed.</li>
			<li>Admin work was real: editing/publishing, support, and allocation.</li>
